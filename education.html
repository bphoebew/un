            <p>The only “cure” to autism is acceptance. If the negativity surrounding autism ceases, then there would be no disability. Thus, our goal is to provide a supportive platform for people on the spectrum to safely come out and re-define their individual identities.  (Ethan Balgemino and Lucas Enriquez)</p>

      <p>Refuse to be Brainwashed: American Exceptionalism aims to combat the misleading curriculum of high school history classes by providing people with research on various historical events not covered in class. Through thorough researching, collecting photos and artifacts from the historical event, organizing for speakers who were present at/are experts on such events to come speak and tell their stories, American Exceptionalism will provide visitors with a new outlook on the American identity.
