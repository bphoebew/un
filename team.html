The core values of SDG 11 have always spoken to me, for as long as I have been pursuing my academic interests. The importance of sustainable and healthy cities has never been more crucial at this moment in history. City population needs to grow dramatically within the next few decades in order to help combat the existential threat of climate change. Therefore, as a leader of goal 11, I feel the urgency to fight for a cleaner, healthier, more equal city from a grassroots level all the way to our established city agencies.</p>
